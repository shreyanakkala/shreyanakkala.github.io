<p> Hi! My name is Shreya Nakkala and I am a senior majoring in Computer Science. 
    I am taking this class because I have worked with data in multiple projects and I want to learn the best 
ways to effectively visualize data.</p>
<h2>Helpful/Insightful Data Visualization</h2>
<img src="good_graph.png" alt="Obama 2013 Interactive Budget" width = 600 class = "center">
<p> Source: https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html?</p>
<p>This interactive visualization provides all sorts of information about the budget spending which I think is insightful. It does not show 
    any bias and that makes the viewer come up with their own opinions. It shows the numbers and allows the viewer to find the specific information 
    they are looking for. It also presents multiple different views of the graph to display the information differently. 
</p>
<h2>Bad/Unhelpful Data Visualization</h2>
<img src="bad_graph.png" alt="Planned Parenthood Graph" width = 600 class = "center">
<p>Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/oct/01/jason-chaffetz/chart-shown-planned-parenthood-hearing-misleading-/</p>
<p> This graph is unhelpful because it does not have a Y axis sigifying the exact amount of increase or decrease. 
    When looking at it the audience just sees the steep lines which are not accurate. The cancer screenings are plotted in the millions whereas 
    the abortions are plotted in the thousands which distorts the numbers due to the way the graph is plotted. There is no relationship 
    there but it forces the viewer to see a relationship between cancer screenings and abortions performed.
